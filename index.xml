      <description>Jupyterlab on linux server  Overview Installation Virtual environment Issues Reference   Overview Jupyterlab is a lightweight but comprehensive and full-development IDE. In addition to write scripts with nice highlights syntax for Python and R as I know, the notebook is probably the most well-known feature with which users are able to write codes along with markdown-style notes. Besides, if you are a user who tends to install as less softwares/packages on your local machine as possible, running Jupyterlab on remote server may be suitable for you.</description>

      <description>Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) is assumed to well manage their resources via metabolic machinary for differentiation. In terms of energy production and consumption, oxygen plays a crucial role but is limited in the embryo. Although previous works have investigated metabolism in hPSC with 20% oxygen (atmospheric level), the physiological oxygen level was measured at about 5% which is much lower than the concentration used in the previous experimental setting. To get more percise metabolic dynamics during hPSC development, the auther compared the cells under two different oxygen levels, 5% and 20%.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD student in computational medicine and bioinformatics at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My research interests include systems and synthetic biology. Based on mathmatical and computational tools, I&amp;rsquo;m currently working in Chandrasekaran&amp;rsquo;s lab to decipher the changes of metabolic network during the stem cell differentiation.</description>

      <title>Build Github webpage by Hugo</title>

      <description>Overview Github offers users a space to build personal pages. Their initial intention is to encourage users recording and sharing their works on Github so as to make the community thriving. While it should be static site hosting which means a front-end page without connections to backend, one could easily and fast initialize a personal website by build-in template, user-defined projects or static site generators such as Hugo and jekyll. I will focus on Hugo in this article.</description>
